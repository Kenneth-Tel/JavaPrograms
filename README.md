## 1. Table 
Table is a basic multiplication table Project
- Inputs: Length and Depth
- Output: Calculated Matrix multiplication table

#### 1.1 Program Rapport
It is currently very inefficient.
- When muliplying length & depth Array into the Matrix, the program does not remember what has been calculated. Example: Calculating 2x4 and 4x2 separately -> wastes resources. 


## 2. Gassuian Distribution
Currently just plays a Galton Board.
- Inputs: Height of Galton Board
- Output: Value of the 'Ball' dropped.

#### 2.1 Program Rapport
This addon is currently still in its early infancy. Further development is needed for better usefullness.

The idea behind this, is that one is able to parse an Array into the playGaltonBoard method, then return a specific index, following normal distribution. --> Loot Table, most likely to drop bad loot, but sometimes good loot.

#### 2.2 Bugs.
None seen as of yet.

#### 2.3 Additions 
- Parse Array
- Bias on Ball chance
