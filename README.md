## 1. Table 
Table is a basic multiplication table Project
- Inputs: Length and Depth
- Output: Calculated Matrix multiplication table

#### 1.1 Program Rapport
It is currently very inefficient.
- When muliplying length & depth Array into the Matrix, the program does not remember what has been calculated. Example: Calculating 2x4 and 4x2 separately -> wastes resources.
